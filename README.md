> This is an independent, fan-made community project built out of love for Path of Exile 2. It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to Grinding Gear Games** in any way. Path of Exile is a trademark of Grinding Gear Games. All game data and assets remain the property of their respective owners.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Path of Exile 2 character analysis and optimization. Provides 38 MCP tools for AI-powered build analysis, passive tree analysis, item mod validation, support gem validation, and Path of Building integration (including a live bridge to a running PoB instance).

## What is This?

This is an **MCP server** - a backend service that gives AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) the ability to analyze your Path of Exile 2 characters and provide optimization recommendations.

**What it does:**
- Fetches your character data from poe.ninja
- Analyzes defensive stats, skills, gear, and passive tree
- Validates support gem combinations (prevents invalid recommendations)
- Inspects spell and support gem data
- Imports/exports Path of Building codes
- Compares your build to top ladder players
- Explains PoE2 game mechanics

**What you need:**
- An AI assistant that supports MCP (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- Python 3.9+ installed
- Your PoE2 character on poe.ninja (public profile)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

**Option A: PyPI (Recommended)**
```bash
pip install poe2-mcp
```

**Option B: From Source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HivemindOverlord/poe2-mcp.git
cd poe2-mcp
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Connect to Your AI Assistant

Choose your platform below:

---

## Claude Desktop Integration

### Option A: Manual Configuration (Recommended for Development)

Edit your Claude Desktop config file:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

The right config depends on how you installed. Pick one.

#### A1. If you ran `pip install poe2-mcp` (Recommended)

Use the `poe2-mcp` console script. It's on your PATH after `pip install` and works on every platform — no absolute path needed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "poe2-optimizer": {
      "command": "poe2-mcp",
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

If Claude Desktop reports it can't find `poe2-mcp`, your `pip` install directory isn't on Claude Desktop's PATH. Either run `which poe2-mcp` (`where poe2-mcp` on Windows) and use the absolute path, or fall back to `python -m`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "poe2-optimizer": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "src.mcp_server"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### A2. If you cloned + `pip install -e .` from source

Point at `launch.py` directly. It does some Windows-specific UTF-8 setup that the bare console script skips:

**Windows:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "poe2-optimizer": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\YourName\\poe2-mcp\\launch.py"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "poe2-optimizer": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/Users/YourName/poe2-mcp/launch.py"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after editing the config. The server will appear in your MCP tools.

### Option B: Download .mcpb Bundle (One-Click Install)

Pre-built MCP bundles are available for one-click installation in Claude Desktop:

1. Download `poe2-mcp-1.0.0.mcpb` from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/HivemindOverlord/poe2-mcp/releases/latest)
2. In Claude Desktop: Settings > Extensions > Install Extension
3. Select the downloaded `.mcpb` file

**Note:** The bundle is ~109MB as it includes all game data files. Python 3.9+ must be installed on your system.

> **Recommendation:** For development or if you want automatic updates, use Option A (manual configuration) with `pip install poe2-mcp`.

## Crafting Knowledge Base (new)

Beyond game data, the server ships a curated **crafting knowledge base**: ~2,800 documents
searchable by BM25 (and semantically, if you install the optional extra), built from two sources:

- A Markdown KB grown across patches 0.4 and 0.5 with a **trust hierarchy**: canonical allowlists
  from poe2db/GGG, verified atomic facts, costed crafting methods, disputes where sources disagree,
  and a list of PoE1-only terms that must never appear in a PoE2 answer.
- A **0.5 crafting compendium**: 82 creator video guides (ASaVeQ, Keyson, LilBotQ, XTheFarmerX) with
  TL;DR / key numbers / method / economics per video plus full transcripts, 92 cross-video
  principles with citations, and a slot-by-slot "what makes a rare sell" reference.

| Tool | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `knowledge_overview` | What's in the KB, what the tiers mean, how to use the tools. Call once. |
| `knowledge_search` | Any crafting question. Returns ranked snippets with a trust tier and a `doc_id`. Filters: kinds, tiers, slot, channel, patch. |
| `knowledge_get` | A full document or one section (`Method`, `Economics`, `transcript`, ...). |
| `knowledge_list` | Browse without searching: "all 0.5 recipes for rings", "Keyson's videos". |
| `crafting_principles` | Market, EV, bankroll, batch and timing rules per creator, each with the videos it came from. |
| `mod_priorities` | Per slot: where value lives (prefix/suffix), top mods, base to hunt, dead mods. |
| `crafting_term` | Confirm an omen / essence / catalyst / currency exists and what it does (tier-1 allowlists). |
| `check_poe1_contamination` | Lint a draft answer for PoE1-only terms (Scouring, Harvest, metacrafting, PoE1 essence names...). |

Every hit carries a **tier**: `canonical` > `verified` > `analysis` > `creator` > `dispute` > `opinion` > `unverified`.
Searches exclude `opinion`/`unverified` unless asked. All divine/exalt figures in the KB are dated
snapshots; use live prices for current numbers.

A recommended agent loop: `knowledge_overview` once → `knowledge_search` → `knowledge_get` on the one or
two docs that matter → `mod_priorities(slot)` before recommending a craft → `check_poe1_contamination`
on the draft answer.

**Semantic search** (optional): `pip install "poe2-mcp[semantic]"` adds `fastembed`; the corpus vectors
ship with the package (`data/knowledge/embeddings.npz`) so only the query is embedded at runtime. Without
it, keyword search still works. The MCP resource `poe2://knowledge/guide` carries the same overview.

Rebuilding the KB from its sources: `python scripts/build_knowledge.py --kb <poe2-knowledge checkout> --compendium <html> [--embed]`.

## Example Usage

Once configured, just talk to your AI naturally:

> "Analyze my character TomawarTheFourth from account Tomawar"

> "Import this poe.ninja URL: https://poe.ninja/poe2/builds/char/..."

> "Can I use Faster Projectiles and Slower Projectiles together?" (uses `validate_support_combination`)

> "Show me all support gems that work with projectiles" (uses `list_all_supports`)

> "What keystones are available for life builds?" (uses `list_all_keystones`)

> "Tell me about Chaos Inoculation" (uses `inspect_keystone`)

> "Compare my build to top Witchhunter players"

> "Explain how armor works in PoE2"

> "What prefixes can roll on items?" (uses `get_available_mods`)

> "Show me all tiers of the Strength mod" (uses `get_mod_tiers`)

> "Can Strength1 and Strength2 exist on the same item?" (uses `validate_item_mods`)

> "Search for fire resistance mods" (uses `search_mods_by_stat`)

The AI will use the appropriate tools automatically.

## Trade API Authentication (Optional)

For `search_trade_items` to work, you need to authenticate with pathofexile.com:

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
python scripts/setup_trade_auth.py
```

This opens a browser for you to log in, then saves your session cookie.

---

## Local Game Database

The server includes a local database with:
- 4,975+ passive tree nodes
- 335+ ascendancy nodes (99% coverage)
- 14,269 item modifiers (2,252 prefixes, 2,037 suffixes, 8,930 implicits)
- Complete skill gem data from Path of Building
- Support gem effects and interactions
- Base items and unique items

Data is loaded from `data/` directory on startup.

### Centralized Game-Data Distribution (new in 1.0.2)

You no longer need to extract `.datc64` files from your own PoE2 install. The MCP automatically downloads the maintained game-data bundle from this repo's GitHub Releases on first run and after each patch (resolves [#53](https://github.com/HivemindOverlord/poe2-mcp/issues/53)).

**How it works:**
1. `launch.py` calls `src/data/data_distributor.ensure_data_current()` during startup
2. It compares `data/version.json` (local) against the latest release tagged `data-v*`
3. If newer data is available, it downloads `poe2-data.zip` and unzips into `data/`
4. The MCP starts with current data

**Opt out** (run your own local extraction instead):
```bash
export POE2_MCP_NO_DATA_FETCH=1   # macOS/Linux
$env:POE2_MCP_NO_DATA_FETCH=1     # PowerShell
```
Then extract via `scripts/extract_poe2_data.py` against your own licensed PoE2 install.

**Manual refresh:**
```bash
python -m src.data.data_distributor
```

**Data policy:** The bundle is extracted exclusively from the maintainer's licensed PoE2 install via the in-repo extraction scripts. No third-party wiki / scraped data is bundled. See `CLAUDE.md` "Data Source Policy" for details.

**Data currency & drift protection:** The shipped datasets are extracted
from the full Patch 0.5 table set (1,019 canonical `.datc64` balance tables
via `scripts/extract_balance_tables_v1.py`), versioned in
`data/game/version.json` (`data-v0.5.0-r12`). `data/game/schema_fingerprints.json`
records every table's row-count/row-size/hash; re-extraction diffs against it
so a future patch that adds, moves, or resizes columns fails loudly instead
of serving silently-wrong data. See `docs/GAME_DATA_RESEARCH.md` for the
reverse-engineered file format and extraction methodology.

```

### Running the Server Directly
```bash
# If installed via pip
poe2-mcp

# From source
python launch.py
```

### Key Files
- `src/mcp_server.py` - MCP server with 38 registered tools
- `src/data/mod_data_provider.py` - Item mod data access layer
- `src/calculator/ehp_calculator.py` - EHP calculations
- `src/optimizer/gem_synergy_calculator.py` - Support gem logic

- `data/poe2_mods_extracted.json` - Item modifier database (14,269 mods)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Server not found" in Claude Desktop
- Check the path in config is absolute (not relative)
- Ensure Python is in your PATH
- Try running `python launch.py` manually to see errors

### "No character found"
- Your character must be on poe.ninja (public ladder)
- Character name is case-sensitive
- Try the full poe.ninja URL with `import_poe_ninja_url`

### Tools return empty results
- Database may need initialization: `python launch.py` handles this
- Check `data/` directory exists with JSON files
